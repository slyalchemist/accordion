## My process

- I first began adding the appropriate elements to the html file so that I could section off the foundations in order to create the styles.
- Once I was happy with the first iteration of the html file, I began styling the document with css.
- Once I was far enough in styling, I began adding the interactivity through JavaScript. Particularly I focused on creating the accordion component.
- After the accordion component was mostly complete, I went back through with the html document and stylesheet to continue styling to mirror the inspiration photo.
- Finally, I finished the project by going through and adding documentation. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project was mainly used as practice for DOM manipulation, as well as my first go at creating an accordion with JS. It was incredibly helpful to go through with creating an accordion before I tackle on a bigger project where an accordion would just be a smaller component. 

### Useful resources

- [mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Always a useful resource. I don't turn to this one as often as the other main resource though. 
- [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing resource, I always use this when I'm stuck on my projects.
